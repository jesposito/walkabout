# Claude Instructions for NotMyself.IO Development Environment

## Prime Directive

> **Rules in `.claude/rules/` are STRICTLY ENFORCED.** They override all default behavior and must be followed exactly as written. Violations break workflows, lose work, or corrupt data.

---

## Critical Rules Summary

These rules come from `.claude/rules/`. Read them in full. Here's what breaks if you violate them:

| Rule File | Critical Requirement | What Breaks If Violated |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|
| `tracking-github.md` | Link PRs to issues with `Fixes #N` | Issues don't auto-close, no traceability |
| `tracking-beads.md` | Sync beads before session end | Work becomes invisible, items orphaned |
| `workflow-implementation.md` | Set item + parents to `in_progress` before coding | Work invisible, parent items never close |
| `workflow-planning.md` | Never create items before plan approval | Wasted work, wrong structure |
| `scripting-hooks.md` | All hooks must be Bun TypeScript | Cross-platform compatibility fails |
| `style-csharp.md` | Use `is not null`, file-scoped namespaces (.NET 10+) | Linting errors, inconsistent codebase |

---

## Session Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Work is NOT complete until pushed to remote.**

<commands>
```bash
# Before ending ANY session:
git status                    # 1. Check what changed
git add <files>               # 2. Stage code changes
bd sync --from-main           # 3. Sync beads
git commit -m "..."           # 4. Commit code
git pull --rebase && git push # 5. Push to remote
git status                    # 6. Verify "up to date"
```
</commands>

**NEVER:**
- Stop before pushing (leaves work stranded)
- Say "ready to push when you are" (YOU must push)
- Skip `bd sync --from-main` (causes merge conflicts later)

→ Full workflow: See `workflow-implementation.md`

## Environment Overview

You have access to 8 plugins providing:
- **Issue tracking**: Beads (`bd` commands) → See `tracking-beads.md`
- **Code review**: `/plannotator-review`, `/code-review`
- **Git automation**: `/commit`, `/commit-push-pr`, `/clean_gone`
- **Language intelligence**: TypeScript, C#, Ruby LSPs
- **Security guidance**: Background security analysis

---

## Permissions

**Pre-approved access:**
- Git operations (except force push, hard reset)
- .NET, npm, Docker, PowerShell commands
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) for issues, PRs, actions
- MCP tools for Docker and Chrome automation

**Requires user confirmation:**
- `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`
- `docker system prune`
- `rm -rf`, `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force`

## Error Recovery

<commands>
```bash
# Beads issues
bd doctor              # Diagnose problems
bd sync --import-only  # Fix sync divergence
bd sync --force        # Force re-sync from source

# Session context lost (after compaction or new session)
bd prime               # Reload beads context (auto-runs via hooks)
bd ready               # Find where you left off
```
</commands>
